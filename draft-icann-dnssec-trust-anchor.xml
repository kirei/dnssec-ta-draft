      <t>The root zone of the Domain Name System (DNS) has been
        cryptographically signed using DNS Security Extensions
        (DNSSEC).</t>

      <t>In order to obtain secure answers from the root zone of the
        DNS using DNSSEC, a client must configure a suitable trust
        anchor.  This document describes how such trust anchors are
        currently formatted and published by IANA.</t>
    </abstract>
  </front>

  <middle>
    <section title="Introduction">
      <t>The Domain Name System (DNS) is described in <xref
    target="RFC1034" /> and <xref target="RFC1035" />. Security
    extensions to the DNS (DNSSEC) are described in <xref
    target="RFC4033" />, <xref target="RFC4034" />, <xref
    target="RFC4035" />, <xref target="RFC4509" />, <xref
    target="RFC5155" /> and <xref target="RFC5702" />.</t>

      <t>A discussion of operational practices relating to DNSSEC can be found
      in <xref target="RFC6781" />.</t>

      <t>In the DNSSEC protocol, resource record sets (RRSets) are signed
      cryptographically. This means that a response to a query contains
      signatures that allow the integrity and authenticity of the RRSet to be
      verified. Signatures are validated by following a chain of signatures to
      a "trust anchor". The reason for trusting a trust anchor is
      outside the DNSSEC protocol, but having one or more trust anchors is
      required for the DNSSEC protocol to work.</t>

      <t>The publication of trust anchors for the root zone of the DNS is an
      IANA function performed by ICANN. A detailed description of corresponding
      key management practices can be found in <xref target="DPS"/>, which can
      be retrieved from the IANA Repository at &lt;https://www.iana.org/dnssec/&gt;.</t>

      <t>This document describes the formats and distribution methods of DNSSEC trust anchors
      currently used by IANA for the root zone of the DNS. Other organizations might have
      different formats and mechansims for distributing DNSSEC trust anchors
      for the root zone; however, most operators and software vendors have
      chosen to rely on the IANA trust anchors.
      IANA may change the formats and distribution methods in the future.</t>

      <t>The formats and distribution methods described in this document are
      a complement to, not a substitute for, the
      automated DNSSEC trust anchor update protocol described in <xref target="RFC5011" />.
      That protocol allows for secure in-band succession of trust anchors 
      when trust has already been established. 
      This document describes one way to establish an initial trust anchor that
      can be used by <xref target="RFC5011" />.</t>

<section title="Definitions">

<t>The term "trust anchor" is used in many different contexts in the security
community. Many of the common definitions conflict because they are specific to
a specific system, such as just for DNSSEC or just for S/MIME messages.</t>

<t>In cryptographic systems with hierarchical structure, a trust anchor is an
authoritative entity for which trust is assumed and not derived. The format of
the entity differs in different systems, but the basic idea, that trust is
assumed and not derived, is common to all the common uses of the term "trust
anchor".</t>

<t>The root zone trust anchor formats published by IANA are defined in <xref
target="ta_formats"/>. <xref target="RFC4033"/> defines a trust anchor as "A
configured DNSKEY RR or DS RR hash of a DNSKEY RR". Note that the formats
defined here do not match the definition of "trust anchor" from <xref
target="RFC4033"/>; however, a system that wants to convert the trusted material
from IANA into a DS RR can do so.</t>

<t>The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD",
"SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED",  "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be
interpreted as described in <xref target='RFC2119'/>.</t>

    </section>

    <section title="IANA DNSSEC Root Zone Trust Anchor Formats and Semantics" anchor="ta_formats">

      <t>IANA publishes trust anchors for the root zone in three formats:

         <list style="symbols">

           <t>an XML document that contains the hashes of the DNSKEY records</t>

           <t>certificates in PKIX format <xref target="RFC5280"/>
           that contain DS records and the full public key
           of DNSKEY records</t>

           <t>certificate signing requests (CSRs) in PKCS#10 format <xref
           target="RFC2986"/> that contain DS records and the full public key
           of DNSKEY records</t>

         </list>

       These formats and the semantics associated with each are described in
       the rest of this section.
       </t>

      <section title="Hashes in XML" anchor="hashes_in_xml">

        <t>The XML document contains a set of hashes for the DNSKEY records
          that can be used to validate the root zone. The hashes are
          consistent with the defined presentation format of Delegation Signer (DS)
          resource records from <xref target="RFC4034"/>.</t>

<t>The TrustAnchor element is the container for all of the trust anchors in the
file.</t>

<t>The id attribute in the TrustAnchor element is an opaque string that identifies
the set of trust anchors. Its value has no particular semantics.
Note that the id element in the TrustAnchor element is different than the id
element in the KeyDigest element, described below.</t>

<t>The source attribute in the TrustAnchor element gives information about where
to obtain the TrustAnchor container. It is likely to be a URL, and is advisory only.</t>

<t>The Zone element in the TrustAnchor element states to which DNS zone this container
applies. The root zone is indicated by a single period (.) character, without any
quotation marks.</t>

<t>The TrustAnchor element contains one or more KeyDigest elements. Each KeyDigest
element represents the digest of a DNSKEY record in the zone defined in the
Zone element.</t>

<t>The id attribute in the KeyDigest element is an opaque string that identifies
the hash. Its value is used in the file names and URI of the other trust anchor
formats. This is described in <xref target="https_and_http"/>.
For example, if the value of the id attribute in the KeyDigest element
is "Kjqmt7v", the URI for the CSR that is associated with this hash will be
&lt;https://data.iana.org/root-anchors/Kjqmt7v.csr&gt;.
Note that the id element in the KeyDigest element is different than the id
element in the TrustAnchor element, described above.</t>

<t>The validFrom and validUntil attributes in the KeyDigest element specify
the range of times that the KeyDigest element can be used as a trust anchor.
Note that the KeyDigest element is optional; if it is not given, the
trust anchor can be used until a KeyDigest element covering the same
DNSKEY record but having a validUntil attribute is trusted by the relying party.
Relying parties SHOULD NOT use a KeyDigest outside of the time range given
in the validFrom and validUntil attributes.</t>

<t>The KeyTag element in the KeyDigest element contains the key tag for the
DNSKEY record represented in this KeyDigest.</t> 

<t>The Algorithm element in the KeyDigest element contains the signing algorithm
identifier for the DNSKEY record represented in this KeyDigest.</t> 

<t>The DigestType element in the KeyDigest element contains the digest algorithm
identifier for the DNSKEY record represented in this KeyDigest.</t> 

<t>The Digest element in the KeyDigest element contains the hexadecimal
representation of the hash for the DNSKEY record represented in this KeyDigest.</t>

    <section title="Implementation Considerations">
      <t>Note: This non-normative section gives suggestions for
        implementing root zone trust anchor retrieval.</t>

      <t>Root trust anchor retrieval by the HTTP or HTTP over TLS
        transports has several implementation considerations to
        ensure robustness, usability and secure operation.</t>

      <section title="HTTP Over TLS Transport">
        <t>The HTTP over TLS transport is suggested
          instead of using the unencrypted HTTP transport for
          implementations that use the XML-format root trust anchors, since the
          latter transport does not provide authentication. It is not
          suggested that implementations restrict certification path
          validation of the HTTP over TLS transport session to the current or
          historical certificate authorities used by the root trust anchor
          server, since doing so would reduce robustness of the
          implementation. It is suggested that the implementation configure
          the HTTP over TLS transport library to: validate the certification
          path against certificate revocation lists <xref target="RFC5280"/>,
          and/or with the online certificate status protocol <xref target="RFC6960"/>;
          and reject self-signed certificates and certification paths that do
          not terminate in a trusted certificate authority.</t>

        <t>Implementations can allow configuration of the URL used
          to retrieve the root trust anchor resources, but it is
          suggested that the default configuration use the "https:" URL scheme.</t>
      </section>

      <section title="XML Validation">
        <t>Implementations may perform strict validation of the
          retrieved XML document against the XML schema; however,
          such an implementation would not be robust against future
          changes in the XML schema. It is suggested that the
          implementation perform "loose" validation, where unknown
          attributes and elements are ignored. This suggestion
          allows for future additions to the XML schema without
          affecting existing implementations.</t>
      </section>

      <section title="Trust Anchor Validation">
        <t>The implementation can ignore trust anchors for which
          the Algorithm or DigestType elements refer to an unknown,
          or unsupported algorithm. Additionally, trust anchors for
          which the Algorithm or DigestType elements refer to a
          deprecated algorithm can be ignored, provided that this
          suggestion does not cause all trust anchors to be
          ignored. Further, note that these suggestions may not
          apply where an implementation shares trust anchors
          between many DNS validating resolvers, since the set of
          supported algorithms may vary between resolvers, and
          could possibly be disjoint.</t>

        <t>The implementation can also ignore a trust anchor when
          the validUntil time, if present, is in the past. If the
          implementation also supports automated updates of trust
          anchors <xref target="RFC5011"/>, it can ignore trust
          anchors where the current time subtracted from the
          validFrom time, if present, is greater than the add-hold
          down time <xref target="RFC5011"/> for the trust
          point.</t>

        <t>The implementation can reject any trust anchor for a
        trust point other than the root zone.</t>

    <section title="IANA Considerations">
      <t>Key Signing Key (KSK) management for the root zone is an
        IANA function. This document describes an initial set of
        publication mechanisms for trust anchors related to that
        management. In the future, additional publication schemes
        may also be made available, in which case they will be
        described in a new document that updates this one.</t>

      <t>Existing mechanisms will not be deprecated without very
        strong technical justification.</t>

      <t>This document serves as the reference for id-mod-dns-resource-record,
      value 70, in the SMI Security for PKIX Module Identifier registry.</t>

    </section>

    <section title="Security Considerations">
      <t>This document describes how DNSSEC trust anchors for the
        root zone of the DNS are published. It is to be expected
        that many DNSSEC clients will only configure IANA-issued trust
        anchors to perform validation, and that the trust anchors
        they use will be those of the root zone. As a consequence,
        reliable publication of trust anchors is important.</t>

      <t>This document aims to specify carefully the means by which
        such trust anchors are published, as an aid to the formats
        and retrieval methods described here being integrated
        usefully into user environments.</t>

    <section title="Historical Note">
      <t>The first KSK for use in the root zone of the DNS was
    generated at a key ceremony at an ICANN Key Management Facility
    (KMF) in Culpeper, Virginia, USA on 2010-06-16.  This key
    entered production during a second key ceremony held at an
    ICANN KMF in El Segundo, California, USA on 2010-07-12.
    The resulting trust anchor was first published on 2010-07-15.</t>
